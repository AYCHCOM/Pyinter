A interval package for Python which deals with interval arithmetic.

The how?
--------
I Started development of this library on a weekend. Initially, I have just implemented features which I wanted to use and a couple of others which it felt natural to include.

The why?
--------
*Warning: the following may or may not be rather geeky, you have been warned!* The inital reason I started developement of an interval package in python was that I couldn't find one which dealt with open and closed intervals and I needed one to play around with some ideas I was having regarding dependency resolution of python packages.
